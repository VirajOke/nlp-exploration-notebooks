No CIs in Onyx
Create New:
* for incidents and work orders, create through "DWP"

Incident example:

* Customer (required)
* It autofills the Company (partner dept)
* Select Template. Not always available.
 - e.g. "GCNET", "Active Directory", "Data center"
 - templates for each
 - just by selecting a template, it selects an automatic "incident type", "impact", "urgency", "status" (agent may change this)

"Description" ultimately Gets pasted into the ticket.
- The template title will be put into the Description at the top (right now this is not the case)

The service desk agent fills in the template (all plain text inside the "Description"

Agent fills Summary (short text created by hand)

Agent fills Affected Service: 

Affected asset: Related / similar to CIs.. but not 1 to 1 relationship. We could ask ODS about it.
- team who does CIs now will probably do Asset list

More about templates:
* Selection of a template is one variable. It isn't enough to route a ticket though. The partner is important. Templates are general, not specific to partners.
* Selecting the CUSTOMER identifies the company
Between these two variables, it automatically selects a group to route it to.

A wrongly selected template is the cause of ticket misassignment.

There is a generic template as well. Curtis' group would look at this and possibly create templates based on how people are using the generic templates.

Suggestion of template could be a good use of Recommender.

Re: computer generated incidents (ECC events) are in Onyx, and some are entered automatically (no agent).

One interesting metric is "transfers" that identifies when a ticket bounces.

- how many templates: 65, will probably be more
 - no hierarchy now. maybe in the future.

For the most part, inputs to model would be an email. 
- Email listener:
 - Interface between Partner ITSM system and ECD
 - In partner's tool, if they determine the issue is SSC responsibility, they hit a button to send the email to SSC ESD.
 - Usually there's a consistent format (partner ITSM template)
 - Other times it might be "Wifi is down at Merivale".
  - These come into the same email listener
 - Partner dept is usually known by the email address
