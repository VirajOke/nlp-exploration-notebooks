CAPSTONE’s next trajectory correction maneuver\\nis targeted for Saturday, July 9.\\n\\nCAPSTONE is now about 289,000 miles from Earth, beyond the orbit of the Moon.\\nCAPSTONE will loop back around and arrive to its lunar orbit – called a near\\nrectilinear halo orbit, or NRHO – Nov. 13. CAPSTONE will fly in the NRHO for\\nat least six months to study the dynamics of the orbit, which is the same one\\nintended for Gateway, a lunar space station for science and human exploration\\nunder [Artemis](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/).\\n\\nTwo technology demonstrations on CAPSTONE could allow future spacecraft to\\nnavigate near the Moon without as much tracking required from Earth.\\n\\n[Read more](https://advancedspace.com/capstone-tcm1-success/) from Advanced\\nSpace, which owns and operates CAPSTONE on behalf of NASA.\\n\\nAuthor  [Sarah Frazier](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/author/sfrazie2/)Posted\\non [July 7, 2022 3:49 pm](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2022/07/07/nasas-\\ncapstone-pulls-off-first-targeting-maneuver-on-journey-to-the-moon/)Categories\\n[Uncategorized](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/category/uncategorized/)Tags\\n[CAPSTONE](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/capstone/),\\n[Cubesats](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/cubesats/),\\n[Gateway](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/gateway/),\\n[Moon](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/moon/), [Space\\nTech](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/space-tech/)\\n\\n## [Mission Team Determines Cause of Communications Issues for NASA’s\\nCAPSTONE](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2022/07/07/mission-team-determines-\\ncause-of-communications-issues-for-nasas-capstone/)\\n\\nAfter a thorough review, teams have determined what led to CAPSTONE's\\ncommunications issue that began on July 4.\\n\\nDuring commissioning of NASA’s\\n[CAPSTONE](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/capstone)\\n(short for Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and\\nNavigation Experiment) spacecraft, the Deep Space Network team noted\\ninconsistent ranging data. While investigating this, the spacecraft operations\\nteam attempted to access diagnostic data on the spacecraft’s radio and sent an\\nimproperly formatted command that made the radio inoperable. The spacecraft\\nfault detection system should have immediately rebooted the radio but did not\\nbecause of a fault in the spacecraft flight software.\\n\\nCAPSTONE's autonomous flight software system eventually cleared the fault and\\nbrought the spacecraft back into communication with the ground, allowing the\\nteam to implement recovery procedures and begin commanding the spacecraft\\nagain.\\n\\nWhile CAPSTONE was out of contact with Earth, the spacecraft autonomously\\nmaintained its orientation to keep its antenna pointed towards Earth and allow\\nthe solar panels to keep its battery charged. CAPSTONE also used its thrusters\\nto perform a standard maneuver to dump excess momentum from its reaction\\nwheels, which are internal wheels that help the spacecraft rotate and point\\nitself.\\n\\nThe mission operations team conducted CAPSTONE’s first trajectory correction\\nmaneuver at approximately 11:30 a.m. EDT today. Teams are currently reviewing\\nthe data to ensure the maneuver was successful, and an update will be provided\\nlater. This maneuver will more precisely target the spacecraft’s transfer\\norbit to the Moon.\\n\\nAuthor  [Sarah Frazier](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/author/sfrazie2/)Posted\\non [July 7, 2022 1:18 pm](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2022/07/07/mission-\\nteam-determines-cause-of-communications-issues-for-nasas-capstone/)Categories\\n[Uncategorized](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/category/uncategorized/)Tags\\n[CAPSTONE](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/capstone/),\\n[Cubesats](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/cubesats/),\\n[Gateway](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/gateway/),\\n[Moon](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/moon/), [Space\\nTech](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/tag/space-tech/)\\n\\n## [Following Communications Recovery, NASA's CAPSTONE Prepares for First\\nManeuver](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2022/07/06/following-communications-\\nrecovery-nasas-capstone-prepares-for-first-maneuver/)\\n\\nFollowing [communications\\nissues](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2022/07/05/further-details-on-\\ncommunications-issues-with-nasas-capstone/), mission teams for NASA's Cislunar\\nAutonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment\\n([CAPSTONE](https://www.nasa.gov/capstone/)) have re-established contact with\\nthe spacecraft through NASA's Deep Space Network.
