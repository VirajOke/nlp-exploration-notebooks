ESD intake methods:
- phone
- self service portal in ECD
- email listener
- directly emailing ESD

These all affect time to respond to ticket
- Desk has up to 3 hours to acknowledge the self-service portal ticket
- 4 hours for email
- 24 hours for email listener
- phone calls real-time

1. Ticket is defined as Incident or SR:
- All incidents opened by ESD start out as SR. Agent opens incident from SR. Every incident has a corresponding SR. Very few exceptions - only event management ("ECC" Enterprise Command Center) opens incidents directly.
- ESI00011 is Enterprise Service Desk
- ESI00043 is request fulfillment. There are work orders that have Parent SR's. Requests are fulfilled via work orders.

2. Service lines can assign back to the desk, or directly to another service line. Problematic tickets MAY NOT come back to the desk, they may bounce around without touching ESI00011.
- Even if an incident gets assigned 3 times, that doesn't mean its a "problematic ticket".
- If it gets back to ESI00011, that is probably a fair statement - these are "problematic" always.
- In either case, the last resolver group is the correct one to assign to.

3. A ticket is assumed to be a “bounced ticket” if it was assigned to at least two distinct groups after being assigned to the service desk.
- Dave: agreed
- Katie: There are some kinds of tickets that consistently bounce, but those will be minimal.
- Dave: In a perfect world all tickets would be resolved once.

4. The last non-service desk resolver-group a ticket is assigned to is assumed to be the correct resolver-group.
- Agreed

5. Time to resolve
- Katie: look at "Source" field in ECD. If "external service desk" == email listener. We have 24 hours. If it says "email" we have 4 hours. "Self service" = 3 hours. Phone call is immediate.
- Scott: Can we assume that when the SR is generated is the time from which we start "counting"?
- Dave: For self-serve and email listener, we have a delay.
- Jules: So for our time estimates, we would just subtract 24 hours from "external service desk" tickets, and 3 hours from "self service".


Jules: We also assume that the text for Ticket_Desc and CI_desc are recorded the same in EDR as in the ECD application.

Configuration Item Desc:
"RETURN TO PSD" is missing in ECD view of CI description
- Jules: As long as we just get the CI numbers from ECD application - then join them into the CI_DESC - it shouldn't be an issue.

Ticket_desc = short description. Appears exactly same in ECD.
